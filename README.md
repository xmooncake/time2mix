## Overview

<div align='justify'>
This project is a tablet-based application designed to streamline workflow management in laundry services. It serves as a tool for monitoring and collecting data on the time spent on each client's laundry, including work durations and breaks.

Integrating with an API, the application fetches client data and uploads reports on service times, break durations, and reasons for breaks, enhancing operational efficiency and transparency.

The app was first written roughly two years ago per client's request, as I was using setState for everything back then you can imagine how unreadable and unmaintable it was. About a year ago it was rewritten using Bloc architecture.
